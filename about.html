       <p> Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Abhinav Tiwari, and I'm a pre-final year Computer Science student at Galgotia College of Engineering & Technology. I have a passion for programming, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies and languages to expand my skillset.<br><br>

        Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. I have also completed various projects that have helped me gain practical experience in software development. These projects range from web development to mobile app development, and they have enabled me to work with technologies such as Java, Python, React, Node.js, and more.<br><br>
        
        Apart from programming, I have a keen interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I'm currently exploring these domains through online courses and personal projects.
        
        As you browse through my portfolio, you'll see some of the projects I have worked on, and I hope they'll give you an insight into my skills and capabilities. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities, so if you have a project or an idea you'd like to collaborate on, feel free to reach out to me.<br><br>
        
        Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio!</p>
